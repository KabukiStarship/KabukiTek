*Updated last:* **2020-02-16**

## Milestone 1

This milestone marks the completion of the Oregon-Cooler smart home firmware MVP. In order to complete this milestone we must temperature, humidity, and water flow measurements using an ARM and RISC-V processor.

## Milestone 2

This milestone marks the completion of the Unicontroller MVP. In order to complete this milestone we must have a working MIDI controller with LED encoder right, an RGB LED DMX animation demo using both PWN & addressable LEDs controlled with a MIDI controller through a TCP connection.

## Milestone 3

This milestone marks the completion of the virtualized hardware simulator MVP. In order to complete this milestone we must be able to run our firmware unit test on the PC on it's own thread and simulate inputs and outputs with LTSpice using interprocess and network mechanism.
