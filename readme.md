# Kabuki Tek Toolkit

The Kabuki Tek Toolkit is a Modern Embedded-C++ [Script2™](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2) Firmware Development Kit (FDK). Script2 is based on the [Automaton Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) Data Specification](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/blob/master/spec/data), which uses easier to read and write 3-letter acronyms to replace the C++ Plain-Old-Data (POD) types; for instance a uintptr_t is is IUW, or Integer Unsigned Word and pronounced eye-you-be.

## Devices

### Unicontroller

The Unicontroller, or Universal Controller, is a device for creating MIDI, DMX, and hardware controllers using a combination of GPIO, SPI, UART, interposes, and network connections.

## Mission and Vision

The mission of Kabuki Tek Toolkit is to create a firmware and toolkit that works with [mbed](https://mbed.com), [RISC-V](https://riscv.org/), and [LTSpice](https://www.analog.com/en/design-center/design-tools-and-calculators/ltspice-simulator.html) in an [Interactive Gym Environment & Educational Kit™](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek) environment. Our vision is to simulate, test, and refine electronics virtually before ever touching a physical prototype.
