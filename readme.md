# igeek.mbed

The kabuki.tek is an Embedded-C++ Script2 and mbed Firmware Development Kit (FDK) and simulation environment for the [Interactive Gym Environment and Educational Kit (IGEEK)](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/igeek).

## Mission and Vision

The mission of IGEEK.mbed is to help you create robust firmware drivers with mbed faster and more reliably with 3D simulations and AI. Our vision is to create a virtualized robotics ecosystem for IGEEK with components that can swapped out dynamically and remotely.
